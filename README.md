# CppDebugWrapperForBuiltInTypes
Wrapper class for built in Cpp (C++) types. Made for debugging purpose: you can find place where some int class member was changed to a certain value, etc. Works with floating point (float, double, long double), integral (int, bool, char16_t, wchar_t, long long, etc.) and pointer types.
